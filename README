So the code here fits some CNNs to the celebA dataset. Nothing is done particularly well, it was all done in a rush, but hopefully it is useful.

The datasets you'll need to steal are here: https://mmlab.ie.cuhk.edu.hk/projects/CelebA.html

The multilabel model needs the attribution dataset. The multiclass classifier needs the image identities dataset. Both need the images

The CNNs are modifications of the ZFnet architecture: https://paperswithcode.com/method/zfnet.
This was a competition winner in 2016, so it is not cutting edge, but it does a good job on images without being too computationally complex.

You don't need a beast of a machine to train these. The multilabel model runs for about 10 hours on my not too hot laptop with only 8gb memory.
The multiclass classifer can only run on 100k images without running out of memory and crashing.

The shiny folder has all of the code needed to display the shiny dashboard and allow it to update live.
The live scoring is a bodge, run the run_live_predictions file with a lot of iterations while you take photos.
Each iteration it will write out a new file for multilabel predictions, multiclass classifications and the eigenface.
The most recent of them will get automatically picked up by the shiny app and displayed.
This could be done better, but it works....

Hope this is useful
